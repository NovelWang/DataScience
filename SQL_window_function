1. WINDOW function is when you do an operation only within a window,
    window is usually defined by 
    OVER (PARTITION BY colA ORDER BY colB)
    And you can add additional limitations such as
    OVER (PARTITION BY col A ORDER BY colB ROWS BETWEEN 10 preceding AND current ROW)


2. What are the operaions that can be used in window functions
(1) all aggregate functions: sum(), count(), avg(), max(), min()
(2) lag and lead: lag(col_A) gives you the previous row of col_A, lead(col_A) gives you the next row of col_A
    By default, lad() and lead() is gapped by 1 row, but you can specify it to be as many as you want.
    lag(col_A, 2)
    lead(col_B, 3)
(3) ntile(): this will assign each row to be different bucket.
    ntile(4) -- quartiles
    ntile(5) -- quintiles
(4) ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
(5) percentile_cont()
    This will give you the nth percentile as you specified.
    e.g. SELECT percentile_cont(0) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) as price_min,
         percentile_cont(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) as price_25th,
         percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) as price_50th,
         percentile_cont(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) as price_75th,
         percentile_cont(1) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY price) as price_max
         FROM table
